<p>Long weekend updates:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Slightly improved startup time; UGWA also no longer should show the weird {{text}} while starting up. (By the way, those are for localization to support other languages.)</li>
  <li>"Events" is now hidden during the brief startup stage to avoid being awkwardly left alone.</li>
  <li>Left/right arrow keys now switch between days</li>
  <li>There is now a message and buttons for when UGWA decides to intelligently jump to the next day to not confuse users.</li>
  <li>UGWA now waits an hour after school before showing the next day's schedule, so parents can know when school ends.</li>
</ul>
