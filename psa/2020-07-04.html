<p>UGWA has been updated for the 2020-21 school year.</p>

<p>Here's a tip for memorizing the schedule that might cease to exist on September 11th later this year:</p>
<ul>
  <li>All periods are 30 minutes on Monday and 75 minutes on other days!</li>
  <li>Announcements infect the last numbered period before lunch and adds an extra 5 minutes! (Hint: SELF is not a numbered period.)</li>
  <li>Days with SELF have brunch; other non-Mondays have breaks!</li>
  <li>When in doubt, just remember that Thursday ends at 2:35 pm!</li>
</ul>

<p>Because the schedule applies to all PAUSD secondary schools, Paly and middle schools can also use UGWA for time management and keeping track of assignments.</p>
