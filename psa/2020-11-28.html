<p>Assync and Interstudent Communication are back!</p>
<p>You might not know them because they have been broken for a while:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Assync</strong> allows you to sync your assignments between devices.
    You can find it in Options.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Interstudent Communication</strong> is a public chat where vowels
    are banned for moderation reasons. It resides in the Utilities tab.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The time left in the period now also shows in the favicon, so it'll still show
  if you pin UGWA. Because of this, UGWA now has a new logo.
</p>
<p>Other changes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Fixed an old bug where UGWA wouldn't update the tab title while viewing a
    different day's schedule.
  </li>
  <li>Improved UGWA's start up time.</li>
  <li>UGWA is now less vulnerable to XSS.</li>
</ul>
